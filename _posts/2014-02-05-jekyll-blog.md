Earlier today I learned Jekyll and rolled out a responsive design blog driven by Jekyll. As I was learning, experimenting and asking myself why Jekyll? I had an ahh moment! 

## Why Jekyll?
* Natural extension to your projects on Github  
* Simple yet powerful tool 
* Empowers developers to do amazing things by leveraging the github platform

In a nutshell my blog is going to grow and add value!
