src="/pics/making-sense-of-data-piechart.png" /> Last week I completed **Making Sense of Data** a free online class offered by Google. 
I was excited to learn from the experts in Google and challenge myself. I had a few aha! moments. 
Best part of this course was clear direction and validation all along the way. 

This course emphasises **Prepare , Analyse &  Apply** model by identifying secondary questions that are specific and 
measurable to answer the primary question. There were a few thousand attendees from all over the world registered for this course.

For my final project I analyzed the pre-course and mid-course questionnaire to find out how successful this course was. 
Below are my observations (**not validated by Google**)

- Attendees with no statistics class completed more content (unit 1, 2 & 3 combined) than other attendees with statistics class. 
  Pie Chart above explains this observation.

- Attendees working with data daily had the highest engagement (added up support and communication related questions)

- Attendees with 5+ years experience working with data had the highest average overall enjoyment 

This course is still going to be available online. I highly encourge this course for anyone interested in analytics. 
Below is more information on getting started!
