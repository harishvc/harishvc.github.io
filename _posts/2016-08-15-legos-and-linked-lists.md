## Linked List

![legos and linked list](/pics/linked-list.png)

A Linked list is a **linear dynamic data structure** where each node is a separate object. 
 * Each node is comprised of two items - data and a reference to the next node
 * The last node has a reference to `None (null)`. 
 * The entry point into a Linked list is called `Head` - reference to the first node
 * If the list is empty then the head is a `null` reference.
 * New node(s) can be **created** and then added to the head, tail or anywhere in the Linked list
 * Node(s) can be removed from the head, tail or anywhere in the Linked list
 * Node(s) can be rearranged on the Linked list

The name 'LEGO' is an abbreviation of the two Danish words "leg godt", meaning "play well". The LEGO brick in its present form was launched in 1958. The interlocking principle with its tubes makes it unique and offers unlimited building possibilities. 


Ability to add and modify existing shapes (data structures) to build interesting shapes (data structures) to solve interesting problems is a common feature of Lego and Linked list. Let's deep dive
