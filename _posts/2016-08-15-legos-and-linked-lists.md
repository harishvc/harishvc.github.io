A linked list is a linear dynamic data structure where each element (node) is a separate object. Each node is comprised of two items - data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to `None (null)`. The entry point into a linked list is called the head. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a `null` reference.

The name 'LEGO' is an abbreviation of the two Danish words "leg godt", meaning "play well". The LEGO brick in its present form was launched in 1958. The interlocking principle with its tubes makes it unique and offers unlimited building possibilities.
