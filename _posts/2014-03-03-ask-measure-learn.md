I first learned about ASK MEASURE LEARN from <a href="http://strataconf.com/strata2014">O'Reilly Strata 2014 (Santa Clara, CA)</a> while watching the audience excitement on social media during Lutz Finger's presentation. 
 
I just completed reading  ASK MEASURE LEARN and would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in optimizing value from social media analytics. 
Authors of the book offer a comprehensive primer on understanding big data with numerous case studies from industries across many sectors that could benefit managers, data scientists or anyone interested in data analytics.
I am also impressed with the extensive collection of references providing a wealth of information and interesting perspectives (see my tweets below). 
The Appendix provides a comprehensive collection of relevant and up-to-date resources for further reading.

As a self-taught <a href="/2014/02/10/sochi2014-day4/">data analyst</a> I now have a better awareness of big data and the right set of questions 
to ask in addition to surrounding complexities. I was sharing my notes as I was reading. Below are my tweets.
