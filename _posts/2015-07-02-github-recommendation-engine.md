Based on repositories, contributors and organizations a simple recommendation engine can be developed to recommend similar repositories. Below are my thoughts. 

##Data Source
Public GitHub timeline from GitHub Archive is parsed hourly using [node.js streaming parser] (https://github.com/harishvc/githubanalytics/blob/master/bin/FetchParseGitHubArchive.js). 
Currently event type `PushEvent`, `CreateEvent` & `WatchEvent` are captured. `PushEvent` contains information about `commits` and `authors`. `CreateEvent` contains 
new repositories. `WatchEvent` contains information about popular repositories. All the data is first stored in MongoDB. Data stored in MongoDB is then 
processed using [Neo4jSync.py] (https://github.com/harishvc/githubanalytics/blob/master/bin/Neo4jSync.py) to generate CSV files and imported into Neo4j (hosted on GrapheneDB).

##Data Model
Currently there are three types of nodes - `Repository`, `Organization` &amp; `People`. `Repository` node contains information about repository and when node was created. `Organization` node contains information about the organization specific repository belongs to and when node was created. `People` node contains information about contributors (*email address of contributors*) and when the node was created. `IN_ORGANIZATION` relationship exists between `Respository` node and `Organization` node. `IS_ACTOR` relationship exists between `Respository` and `People` node. There can be more than one person contributing to a repository.

##Simple Recommendation Engine
Similar repositories can be recommended based on contributors and organizations.
<code data-gist-id="2ae4de25bfa75e5bd680" data-gist-line="17-20" data-gist-hide-footer="true"></code>
For repository ```edx/edx-platform``` the cypher query finds all repositories that share the relation ```IS_ACTOR``` or ```IN_ORGANIZATION``` . The result is then sorted by number of connections in descending order.


Sample Output -
<code data-gist-id="2ae4de25bfa75e5bd680" data-gist-line="23-28" data-gist-hide-footer="true"></code>
Here repository ```edx/edx-platform``` and ```amir-qayyum-arbisoft/edx-platform``` share 25 contributors. Isn't it amazing!

##Future Work
Additional types of nodes can be created to improve the recommendations. The cypher query could be further optimized.
