Today I attended the International Nodebots Day in San Francisco. I picked up an Arduino starter kit, 
installed <i>johnny-five</i> (already had node installed) and got an LED to strobe on and off. Latter I tried using <i>Tessel</i>. 
After installing necessary modules I tested camera, climate and  accelerometer. The picture quality was good 
and with minimal effort I could display temperature and humidity.

Using Node.js you can programatically trigger notification via email, text or tweet. You can also programatically
trigger recepies using automation tools like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> and <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>. Certainly I see amazing endless possibilities!
