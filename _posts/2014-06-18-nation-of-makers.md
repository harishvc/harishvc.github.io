Today, President Obama hosted the first ever White House  Maker Faire and said in a proclamation that made <b>June 18</b> the <b>National Day of Makers</b>.

President Obama tweet "If you can imagine it, then you can do it" eloquently sums up Maker Faire - a faire driven by curiousity, creativity and imagination.
I have always been intrigued by the mythbuster performances, creative lego objects, paper rocket launcher, diet coke and mentos eruption and electric Giraffe Russell to mention a few. 
They all have a story to tell and get you start thinking!
