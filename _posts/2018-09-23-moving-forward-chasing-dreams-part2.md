Almost two years ago I challenged myself to get outside my comfort zone by accepting an opportunity in a startup where I had limited domain expertise.

Working in a startup is a unique experience filled with multiple dimensions that are not easily captured in just one article. Sharing a common purpose and making customers successful transformed my experience into an amazing journey.

My amazing journey kept me on my toes, provided an opportunity to learn new things, and reinforced three powerful life lessons.

I shared my story [Next Challenge? Moving Forward & Chasing Dreams (part 2)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-challenge-moving-forward-chasing-dreams-part-2-chakravarthy/) on LinkedIn
