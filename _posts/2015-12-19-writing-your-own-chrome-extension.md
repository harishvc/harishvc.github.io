Do you catch yourself repeating tasks on your browser? How can I save time? Exactly this was the driving factor behind learning to write my own Chrome extension.

I found three amazing tutorials that provide a step by step introduction to building your own Chrome extension.

* [Sitepoint's 10 minute tutorial](http://www.sitepoint.com/create-chrome-extension-10-minutes-flat/) provides an excellent starting point to build an extension quickly and then spend the next 
  several minutes taking a closer look at the dynamics and code behind developing an extension.

* [Gabe Berke-Williams Chrome extension tutorial](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-make-a-chrome-extension) offers in-depth explanation behind developing a extension. Specifically the anatomy of 
  manifest.json, idea behind content scripts and backend scripts  and messages passing between backend scripts and content scripts. 

* [Tom Boutell's extension to Google Calendar](http://justjs.com/posts/chrome-extensions-how-to-enhance-google-calendar-and-other-web-apps-you-didn-t-write) tutorial takes a few giant steps and offers an interesting perspective about making changes to 
  Google Calendar DOM on the **fly** with audio and animation!
