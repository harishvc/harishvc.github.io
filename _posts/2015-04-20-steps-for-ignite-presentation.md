Congrats! Your submission got accepted at Ignite. Pat yourself on the back. 
Ignite presentations are 5 minutes long and slide advances every 15 seconds automatically (speedy presentations). 
This presentation format makes Ignite unique and challenging. 

I presented [What's your next challenge?](http://harishvc.com/2015/04/30/whats-is-your-next-challenge/) 
at [Ignite, Fluent in San Francisco](http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/detail/40114). 
My first Ignite presentation. I am sharing my process to hopefully help Ignite presenters. Perspectives welcome.

#Step 1: Ground Work
Gather as much information as possible before getting started. 
Some of the questions include presentation format (example: power point)?, due date?, multimedia?, rehearsal time? contact person? 
Usually these questions are answered in the acceptance email.

#Step 2: Write your presentation down
*  Write your entire presentation down in a text editor or something similar, donâ€™t worry about formatting 
*  Write <b>full sentances</b>. Example: I am here to share my story that made a difference personally & professionally 
*  Break your story into smaller paragraphs
*  Identify <b>one piece of information</b> you want your audience to take away from your presentatation. Include that information at the start, middle and end of your presentation
*  Practice your presentation until you feel comfortable covering your entire presentation in 5 minutes


#Step 3: Start working on your slides
*  Capture your presentation material in your slide
*  Use images to convey your message as much as possible - 15 seconds is too short to read everything on the slide
*  Provide credit for your image (check copyright). If you have people in your image, please check with them first
*  If possible use the entire slide for your content (no header and footer)
*  Provide your contact information and how audience can get to your presentation, earlier in the presentation so you can use that 15 seconds to cover your next slide 
*  Checkout Guy Kawasaki's infograph, [Ten Easy Ways to Make Your Pitch Rock!](http://guykawasaki.com/ten-easy-ways-to-make-your-pitch-rock/)


#Step 4: Practice , Practice and Practice

*  Start practicing your slides. Engage your family, friends and colleagues to give you feedback if possible. Iterate until you feel comfortable. 
   Practice presenting standing up if possible.

*  Prepare for <b>surprises</b>. Practice sharing one piece of information your audience needs to know about each slide in about 10 seconds.  This backup plan will immensely help, if you get interrupted by a round of applause, loose your train of thoughts, technical difficulty etc


#Step 5: Show up early for your presentation
*  Meet the host and fellow presenters
*  Get comfortable with your audience, presenters and location
*  Check with the host or AV tech when your 5 minutes will start 
*  Check where you see your slides while you are presenting, is there a monitor in front of you? or do you need to turn back? These logistics will make a world of difference and save you time

Deliver an awesome presentation and ignite your audience! Perspectives welcome.
