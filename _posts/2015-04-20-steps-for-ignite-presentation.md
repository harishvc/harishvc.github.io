Congrats! Your submission got accepted at Ignite. Pat yourself on the back. 
Each ignite presentation is  5 minutes long and slides move forward once every 15 seconds automatically. 
This presentation style makes Ignite unique and challenging. I am documenting my process to hopefully help Ignite presenters. Perspectives welcome.

#Step 1: Ground Work
Gather as much information as possible before getting started. 
Some of the questions include presentation format (example: power point)?, due date?, multimedia?, rehearsal time? contact person? 
Usually these questions are answered in the acceptance email.

#Step 2: Write your presentation down
Write your entire presentation down on a text editor (or something similar, donâ€™t worry about formatting). 
Write <b>full sentances</b> (example: I am here to share my story that made a difference personally & professionally.) 
and break them into smaller paragraphs. Include one thing you want your audience to take away 
from your presentatation at the start, middle and end of your presentation. Practice your presentation until you feel 
comfortable covering your entire presentation in 5 minutes.


#Step 3: Start working on your slides
Capture your presentation material in your slide. Use images to convey your message as much as possible - 15 seconds is too short 
to read everything on the slide. Provide credit for your image (check copyright). If you have people in your image, please check with them.
If possible use the entire slide for your content (no header and footer). Provide your contact information and how audience can get to your presentation, earlier in the slide (hint: use that 15 seconds to cover 
your next slide).

#Step 4: Practice , Practice and Practice

*  Start practicing your slides. Engage your family, friends and colleagues to give you feedback if possible. Iterate until you feel comfortable. 
   Practice presenting standing up if possible.

*  Prepare for <b>surprises</b> by sharing one piece of information your audience need to know about each slide in about 10 seconds.  This backup plan will immensely help, if you get interrupted by a round of applause, loose your train of thoughts, technical difficulty etc


#Step 5: Show up early for your presentation
Meet the host and fellow presenters. Get comfortable with people and location. Check with the host or AV tech when your 5 minutes will start. 
Also check where you see your slides while you are presenting, is there a monitor in front of you? or do you need to turn back? 
These logistics will make a world of difference and save you time, so can have an awesome presentation and ignite your audience.

Perspectives welcome.
